Practice getting input from user using Scanner Class in Java

Using the Scanner class in Java to get input from users is a fundamental practice that helps develop several important software development skills. First, it introduces beginners to handling dynamic input, which is essential for creating interactive programs. Instead of relying solely on predefined data, the Scanner class allows developers to build software that can adapt to different user inputs, a skill crucial for real-world applications.

Working with user input also teaches the importance of error handling. When using Scanner, developers often encounter issues like invalid input types (e.g., the user entering text when a number is expected). Managing these exceptions encourages better programming practices, such as using try-catch blocks, input validation, and providing feedback to the user, all of which are critical for creating robust, user-friendly applications.

Additionally, using Scanner deepens understanding of data types and conversion. Input data from users is typically in string format, so developers must learn how to convert this input into the appropriate data types (e.g., int, double, boolean). This process reinforces key programming concepts, like type casting and parsing, which are foundational skills for any developer.

Overall, working with the Scanner class fosters problem-solving skills, user-centric thinking, and a deeper understanding of Java fundamentals.
